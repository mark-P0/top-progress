# Google homepage

Live preview available [here](https://mark-p0.github.io/top-progress/1-Foundations/4-FrontEnd/3-project-google.html). The page design was based on how it would appear as a user from the Philippines (see `actual_google.png`).

Some of the things I learned (and used A LOT)

- **Flexbox**. This [article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) acted as a reference for me, and this [one](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) showed me how to center-align things.
- **Emmet**. Found this out because of a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtyMdRzvi0w).
- **CSS normalization**. Was particularly peeved by random margins when I was trying out React. Turned out browsers apply CSS themselves and it is fairly commonplace to reset/override them.
