# Progress on "The Odin Project"

<!-- # top-progress -->

This repository is for two (2) things:

- Keeping the files I create in my journey on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- Serving as my much-needed practice on using `git` commands... _yikes_

## External Links

These contain some supplementary materials/projects I encountered during the course:

- [JavaScript exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises), by The Odin Project
- [JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30), 30 challenges/projects/tutorials
